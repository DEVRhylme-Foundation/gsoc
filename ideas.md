# List of ideas for projects

## Information for Students

Make sure you have read the  [contributor guidance](https://github.com/DEVRhylme-Foundation/gsoc/blob/main/contributor-guidance.md)

The below ideas were contributed by current DevRhylme Foundation contributors. They are sometimes
vague or incomplete.
Questions related to these ideas should be asked on the related [GitHub
discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/DEVRhylme-Foundation/discussions).

Becoming accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive.
Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the topic of their
proposed project and have been active in the discussions.
Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work.
On the other hand, creating a completely new idea without first consulting
potential mentors also rarely works.

Also keep in mind that these are just proposals, we are open to new ideas you
might have!
Do you have an awesome idea you want to work on for Devrhylme Foundation but that is not among
the ideas below?
That's cool. We love that!
Please get in touch with a mentor early on and make sure your project is
realistic and within the scope of Devrhylme Foundation.

If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on github, slack, or
at contact@devrhylme.org.
